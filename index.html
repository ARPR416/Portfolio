        <h3>Decoder Ring</h3>
				<p>This app was designed by me. The purpose of this app is to encrypt and decrypt user-input using three different ciphers. The Caesar Shift, the Polybius Square and the Substitution Model. This was made using mostly Javascipt functions, statements and methods. Some methods and statements include: if statement, forEach method, a for loop statement, etc... You can test the ciphers in the following link:<a href="https://arpr416.github.io/Decoder-Ring/" target="_blank">Decoder Ring</a>. If you are curious on how this one done, you can refer to my method for completion in my github repository. You can find my repository here:<a href="https://github.com/ARPR416/Decoder-Ring" target="_blank">Decoder Ring Repository</a>. Feel free to check both out !</p>

        <h3>Podomoro Timer</h3>
				<p>The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This is a pending project that I am currently working on. I plan on using lot of asynchronous code to get this app off the ground. Feel free to e-mail me if you have any advice.</p>
